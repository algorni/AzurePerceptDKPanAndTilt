# AzurePerceptDKPanAndTilt
PerceptDK Camera Sensor has a great Field of View (120Â° diagonal) but what if you want to see beyond this range?  An option could be to host multiple cameras to cover a wider angle or just let it move!


In this git hub repo you will find a coupel of custom IoT Edge module to control 2 servo which i've used to build a Pan & Tilt mechanics with a simple 3D printer.
The servo are directly controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico board connected to the Percept Carrier Board and orchestrated by those IoT Edge module.
